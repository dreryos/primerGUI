# primerGUI

The plan is to create simple GUI app in python for designing primers. It aims to automatize selecting "missing nuklids" for specific ATTs.

## Used packages

```python
pip install PyQt6
re
pip install tinydb
pip install primers
```

## TODO:

- [x] Save your specific ATTs in DB
- [x] Operate with multiple targets
- [x] Pick filling nuclides with smaller *Tm*
- [ ] Edit/remove ATTs in DB
- [ ] Show properties of primers
- [ ] Export report
